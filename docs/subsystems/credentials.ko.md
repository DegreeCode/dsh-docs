# 사용자 자격 증명

[English](credentials.md) | [中文](credentials.zh.md) | 한국어

[dsh-credentials](../../packages/credentials/credentials)의 자격 증명 seam은 시크릿을 구성 밖으로 유지합니다. 즉 설정 섹션과 `cordis.yml` 항목은 *참조*(환경 변수 이름)를 담고, [dsh-credentials-local](../../packages/credentials/credentials-local) 같은 제공자가 값을 소유하며, 소비자는 작업마다 참조를 한 번 해석합니다. LLM 어댑터는 모델 요청마다 한 번 해석하므로, 순환된 자격 증명이 재시작 없이 바로 다음 요청에 적용됩니다. 하나의 seam 전역 규칙이 모든 제공자를 묶습니다. 즉 저장된 값이 비어 있으면 어디에서나 부재입니다.

출처: [`packages/credentials/credentials/src/index.ts`](../../packages/credentials/credentials/src/index.ts)

## 정체성

참조는 POSIX 스타일 환경 변수 이름으로 자격 증명 하나를 지칭합니다. 브랜드는 호출자가 자격 증명 참조를 패키지나 프로세스 사이에서 전달되는 다른 문자열과 섞지 못하게 하고, 생성 시 셸 식별자 문법을 검증합니다.

```ts type-equiv
/** Nominal reference to one credential: a POSIX-style environment-variable name. */
type CredentialRef = Branded<'CredentialRef'>
```

<a id="resolution"></a>
## 해석

`resolve(ref)`는 값을 공급한 제공자 정의 소스 계층과 함께 그 값을 반환하고, 구성되지 않았으면 `undefined`를 반환합니다. 소비자는 작업마다 다시 해석하며 작업 사이에 캐시하지 않습니다. 그 작업별 읽기가 핫 업데이트 메커니즘입니다.

```ts type-equiv
/** One resolved credential value and the source layer that supplied it. */
interface ResolvedCredential {
  /** The non-empty secret value. */
  value: string
  /** Provider-defined source layer id (the local provider uses `env`, `file`, `project-env`, and `user-env`). */
  source: string
}
```

## 설명

`describe(ref)`는 값을 절대 노출하지 않고 구성 표면에 답합니다. 즉 참조가 해석되는지, 어느 계층에서인지, `set`이 현재 성공할지 여부입니다. 로컬 제공자는 자신이 관리하는 파일을 시작 환경보다 위에 두므로, 값을 저장하면 항상 실효 쓰기 가능 계층이 만들어지고, 값을 제거하면 다시 시작 환경이나 `.env` 폴백이 드러납니다.

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * Source and writability facts for one reference, safe for configuration UIs —
 * never the value. The view has no slot a value could ride in, which is what
 * lets the whole read half cross the Remote wire.
 */
interface CredentialInfo {
  /** Whether resolving the reference would currently return a value. */
  configured: boolean
  /** Source layer currently supplying the value; absent while unconfigured. */
  source?: string
  /** Whether the active provider can write this reference. */
  writable: boolean
}
```

## 변경 커밋

`credentials/reference-updated (ref)`는 제공자 관리 소스에 커밋된 변경(`set`, `unset`, 또는 저장소에서 관찰된 외부 편집) 뒤에 발생합니다. 주변 프로세스 환경 변경은 관찰할 수 없으므로 절대 emit되지 않습니다. 소비자는 이 이벤트가 필요하지 않으며(작업마다 다시 해석합니다), 이것은 “구성됨” 배지를 새로 고치는 구성 표면을 위해 존재합니다.

## 내장 Platform 자격 증명

PlatformSession은 getPlatformSession에서 온 호스트 전용 스냅샷입니다. 즉 origin은 구성된 Platform 발급자를 지칭하고, token은 그 저장된 계정 자격 증명을 담습니다. userId는 가장 최근에 성공한 getProfile의 안정적인 계정 ID를 반복하며, 성공하기 전이나 그 프로필에 ID가 없으면 null입니다. 스냅샷은 자체 프로필 요청을 내지 않고 그 ID를 재사용하므로, 알 수 없는 ID는 호출자를 지연시키지 않고 userId를 null로 남깁니다. 안정적인 ID가 처음 사용 가능해지거나 바뀐 프로필 읽기는 `watch(signal, true)`를 쓰는 호스트 구독자에게만 알리며, 이를 통해 아이덴티티 소비자가 스냅샷을 다시 읽습니다. 소비자는 영속 브라우저 저장소를 origin과 userId로 키잉하고 null에는 임시 저장소로 폴백합니다. 로그아웃된 계정과 자격 증명 읽기 중에 바뀐 자격 증명은 스냅샷을 반환하지 않고, 발급자가 일치하지 않으면 실패합니다. 네이티브 소비자는 자격 증명이 바뀔 때 문서 무효화를 소유합니다. 이 스냅샷은 account-controller RPC, AccountView, AccountDetails에서 제외됩니다.

AccountDetails.balance는 충전 지갑을 value에, 프로모션 지갑을 bonusWallets에 투영하며, 통화와 소수 잔액 문자열은 각각 독립적입니다. 실패한 질의는 지갑 배열을 담지 않습니다.

보너스 알림 질의는 현재 Platform 계정 id와 서버 순서의 대상 주문을 담은 AccountBonusBatch를 반환합니다. AccountBonusNotification은 자격 증명을 투영하지 않고 서버 메시지와 만료를 유지합니다. 확인 처리는 예상 계정 id와 주문 id를 담으며, 계정이 바뀐 뒤에는 호스트가 이를 거부합니다. 두 알림 연산 모두 언어 질의 매개변수 없이 x-client-locale을 통해 시작한 UI 언어를 사용합니다.

## Cordis API

Generated from source by `scripts/gen-cordis-catalog.ts` (verified fresh by `pnpm run verify-cordis-catalog` in doc-sync; regenerate with `pnpm run gen-cordis-catalog`) — the language sides differ only in locale-specific paired document paths. Signature blocks use a `ts cordis-catalog` fence and keep the original source JSDoc; dispatch modes are defined in the [primer](../cordis-primer.ko.md#디스패치-모드), and the framework-inherited `ctx` API lives in [cordis-api/inherited.md](../cordis-api/inherited.md).

<a id="ctxcredentials--credentialprovider-abstract-seam"></a>

### `ctx.credentials` — `CredentialProvider` (abstract seam)

Abstract credential service over two key spaces that answer two questions.

A CredentialRef answers "what is behind this environment-variable name": the provider-managed store first, then ambient fallbacks such as the process environment and `.env` files. One seam-wide rule binds that half: an empty stored value is absent everywhere — `resolve` skips it, `describe` reports it unconfigured — so a blank never masquerades as a configured secret.

A CredentialKey answers "what credential does this plugin hold for this id". Nothing can layer here — an authorization grant has no environment to be read from — so presence of the record is the whole fact, and modifyRecord is the only write path because a correct write depends on the current value (a token refresh is read-decide-replace under one lock).

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * Resolve one reference to its current value. Resolution is per call:
 * consumers re-resolve at each operation and must not cache across
 * operations — that per-operation read is what makes a changed credential
 * reach the next operation without a restart.
 * @param ref - the reference to resolve.
 * @returns the value and its source, or `undefined` while unconfigured.
 */
abstract resolve(ref: CredentialRef): Promise<ResolvedCredential | undefined>

/**

### `ctx.credentialsController` — `CredentialsController`

Host service backing the generated `ctx.remote.credentials` namespace. It carries every wire obligation the credential seam itself does not: the batch fan-out bound, the field-by-field view projection, the reference-grammar guard, and the refusal mapping. Secret values cross in one direction only — no method here returns one.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * Describe several references for one configuration surface. Batched because
 * a settings page describes every reference its rows name at once, and one
 * round trip keeps those rows from settling separately.
 * @param refs - reference names, at most {@link MAX_DESCRIBE_REFS}; a name outside the grammar
 *   rejects the whole call as `gateway/bad-request`.
 * @returns one view per requested name, keyed by that name.
 * @throws RemoteError when the request is invalid or no credential provider is mounted.

The account Service Definition exposes getState, getProfile, getBalance, getUnnotifiedBonuses, ackBonusNotified, startSignIn, cancelSignIn, signOut, watch, and Host-only resolveToken and getPlatformSession. The platform provider implements it with an AuthorizationFlow and a private GrantRecord. AccountView distinguishes stored presence from server validation; attempt IDs bind cancellation to one local flow. See [the account package](../../packages/credentials/deepseek-account/README.md).

`AccountClientMetadata` carries `version` from the caller’s `DSH_CLIENT_VERSION`, its active UI `locale`, and `timezoneOffsetSeconds` sampled when the operation begins. The offset is local time minus UTC in seconds: UTC+8 is `28800`. It contains no credentials. Login attempts retain their initiating metadata through exchange and cancellation; sign-out retains its metadata for revocation retries.
